## 📚 Day 5 – Mini Multiplication Calculator 🧮

Welcome to the Mini Multiplication Calculator project! This is a fun little Java console app that lets users generate multiplication tables interactively. It’s beginner-friendly, emoji-powered, and perfect for leveling up those Java loops and logic skills. 🔁🔥


## 💡 What It Does

This Java app allows users to:

 - Input any number they want a multiplication table for 🔢

 - View the full table from 1 to 11 📊

 - Choose whether they want to continue or exit the program gracefully 🚪👋

 - All wrapped up in a playful, colorful, emoji-vibed terminal experience! 🎨✨


## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

- while loops 🔁

- for loops ⏱

- Scanner input handling 💬

- String manipulation + .toLowerCase()

- Control flow with if-else statements 🧭

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you’ve got Java installed (Java 17+ is great, but older versions work too).

2. Compile it in your terminal:

```

javac MultiplicationTable.java

```

3. Run the Program

```

java MultiplicationTable

```

4. Follow the prompts and enjoy! 🥳

## 📸 Sample Output

```

🌟===== Welcome To My Mini Multiplication Calculator 🧮✨ =====

🔢 Enter the number for the multiplication table: 5

📊 Multiplication Table for 5:
➡️ 5 x 1 = 5
➡️ 5 x 2 = 10
➡️ ...
➡️ 5 x 11 = 55

❓ Wanna run another table? (yes/no): yes

🔁 Okayyy let’s run another one! 🎉

```

## 🛠️ Future Ideas (if you're feelin' spicy)

- Let users set custom ranges (like up to 20 or 100) 🧠

- Add color output using external libraries 🌈

- Turn it into a GUI app with JavaFX or Swing 🖥️
