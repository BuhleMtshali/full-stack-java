# 📚 Day 4: Mini Grade Checker 🧮

Welcome to Day 4 of my 161-Day Software Engineering Journey! Today’s task was to build a **Grade Checker** that calculates a student’s percentage and gives a cute lil message based on their performance. 🌟

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Java program is a simple console-based application that:
- Asks for your **name**, **module name**, **mark obtained**, and the **total mark** for a test.
- Calculates your **percentage**.
- Displays a message based on your performance using **conditional statements**.

Basically, it's your friendly academic cheerleader 🥳... or your wake-up call 😬.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- ☕ Java
- 💻 IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- 🧠 Logic + If-Else Statements
- 📥 Scanner class for input

## 🔍 What I Learned

- How to use the `Scanner` class to get user input.
- Integer vs Floating-Point division (💀 RIP to my 0% bug before casting).
- Writing clean conditional logic with `if-else if` statements.
- How to convert integers to doubles to avoid evil integer division math traps.
- Writing user-friendly and encouraging output. ✨

## 📸 Sample Output

```

======= Welcome to My Mini Grade Checker📝 ======
Enter Your name: Buhle
Enter the name of the module you want to calculate for: Java Basics
What mark did you get: 78
What was the test out of: 100
Okay Buhle you got 78 in your Java Basics which was out of 100, so you got 78.0%, Congrats, you got a C

```

## 🧪 Features

- 🧮 Accurate grade calculation with floating-point precision

- 🎯 Feedback based on score ranges:

  - A+ (90–100)

  - A− (80–89)

  - C (70–79)

  - D+ (60–69)

  - D (50–59)

  - F (Below 50)


## ✨ Next Steps

- Add support for multiple modules in one session
- Add letter grading scale customization
- GUI version with JavaFX (when I’m feeling brave 🥴)

## 💡 Reflection

It’s wild how just a few lines of code can recreate a tool that teachers actually use. I felt like I was building my own little **report card generator**. Definitely boosted my confidence today! 💪
