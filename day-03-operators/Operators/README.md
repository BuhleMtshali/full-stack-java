# 🧮 Day 3 - Mini Area Calculator 🍄

Welcome to **Day 3** of my Full-Stack Java journey!  
Today’s project is a fun and interactive **Mini Area Calculator** built in Java that calculates the area of three different 2D shapes: `rectangle`, `triangle`, and `circle`.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

This console-based Java app allows users to:

- 🟩 Calculate the area of a **rectangle**
- 🔺 Calculate the area of a **triangle**
- 🟠 Calculate the area of a **circle**

It uses a **`switch` statement** to handle shape selection and provides clean, formatted output.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **Tools:** Scanner for user input
- **Features:** Switch statements, Try-with-resources, Math class

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- `Scanner` class for input handling
- `Switch` statements for control flow
- Basic geometry logic and formulas
- Clean output formatting with `printf`
- Resource management with `try-with-resources`

---

## 🧪 Sample Output

```
====== 🍄 Welcome to the Mini Area Calculator 🧠 ======
Enter the shape name (rectangle, triangle, circle): triangle
Enter the base (cm): 10
Enter the height (cm): 5
✅ The area of the triangle is: 25.00 cm²

```

## 🔣 Formula Recap

```
---

| Shape     | Formula                         |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| Rectangle | Area = length × width           |
| Triangle  | Area = ½ × base × height        |
| Circle    | Area = π × radius²              |

## 📁 File Structure

```

📦 AreaCalculator
┣ 📜 AreaCalculator.java
┗ 📄 README.md

```

## 🦾 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or copy the `.java` file into your Java IDE.
2. Run `AreaCalculator.java`.
3. Follow the prompts in the console.
4. Enjoy calculating areas like a math wizard 🔮

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Doesn't handle invalid (non-numeric) input.
- Only supports three basic shapes.

---

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Add more shapes like trapezoids and hexagons.
- Include unit selection (e.g., inches, meters).
- Handle input exceptions for invalid types.
