# 🚀 Day 01: Java Dev Setup & The Coding Throne 👑

Welcome to Day 1 of my 🔥 Full-Stack Java Developer Journey! Today’s all about **setting up the kingdom** (aka my dev environment) and making sure my machine is ready to rule the code world. If your setup ain't right, your whole journey gonna be shaky — so let's get this solid from the jump. 💪

## 🧰 What I Did Today

- ✅ Installed **Java 21 JDK** ☕
- ✅ Installed **IntelliJ IDEA** (my magic wand for writing Java) ✨
- ✅ Installed **VS Code** (for frontend HTML/CSS/JS) 👨🏾‍🎨
- ✅ Set up **Git** and linked my repo to GitHub 🐙
- ✅ Configured **Java environment variables** (JAVA_HOME + PATH) 🧬
- ✅ Created my first “Hello, World” program in Java 🌍

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ☕ Java 21 | The main programming language for backend |
| 💡 IntelliJ IDEA | Java IDE for writing clean, smart code |
| 🧠 VS Code | For building frontend stuff later |
| 🐙 Git + GitHub | Version control and pushing projects |
| 🪄 Command Line | For compiling & running Java like a boss |
| 🌱 Java Environment Variables | So my terminal knows what’s up |

## 🧠 Concepts Learned

- What JDK and JRE are (and how they’re not the same thing 🧃 vs ☕)
- How to compile and run Java files with `javac` and `java`
- What an IDE is and why IntelliJ makes life *so* much easier
- Git init > add > commit > push > profit ✅


## 🔥 Today's Energy

“Discipline > Motivation.”  
Today I showed up. That’s what matters. Day 1 = bricks laid. 🧱 Tomorrow, we start learning Java syntax like a real sorcerer. 🧙🏾‍♀️

## 📌 Next Up:  
**Day 02 → Java Variables, Strings, and Numbers** 💡  
From setup to syntax. We’re building muscle memory now!
