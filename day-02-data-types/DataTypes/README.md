# 🚀 Day 2 - Strings, Numbers & User Input 💬🔢

Welcome to Day 2 of your **Full-Stack Java Adventure**!  
Today we're diving into the magical realm of **Java data types**, **user input**, **math ops**, and that sweet sweet `Scanner` class.  
Let’s get real comfy working with numbers and text, 'cause your whole Java life depends on it. 🧠💻

## 🛠️ What You’ll Learn

- 🗣 How to take user input using `Scanner`
- 🔢 Use numbers & perform arithmetic in Java
- 📆 Use Java's `LocalDate`, `Period` and `Year` from the time API
- 🧠 Practice conditionals and switch statements
- 🧪 Handle edge cases like division by zero and time travel 🤖

## 📘 Project 1: Mini Age Calculator 👶📅

Calculate the user's age in **years**, **months**, and **days** using the powerful `LocalDate` and `Period` classes from Java's time API. 

### 🌟 Features

- ✅ Takes full birthdate input (year, month, day)
- ✅ Uses Java time API to calculate accurate age
- ✅ Handles invalid or future dates with fun messages 🛸

### 👇 Sample Output

## 📘 Project 1: Mini Age Calculator 👶📅

Calculate the user's age in **years**, **months**, and **days** using the powerful `LocalDate` and `Period` classes from Java's time API. 

### 🌟 Features

- ✅ Takes full birthdate input (year, month, day)
- ✅ Uses Java time API to calculate accurate age
- ✅ Handles invalid or future dates with fun messages 🛸

### 👇 Sample Output

Hi Buhle 🧑🏼‍🎤!
You are: 24 years, 3 months, and 12 days old 🎉✨


### 🔥 Bonus Logic Concepts

- Use of `try-catch` to validate date input
- Date validation (no future babies allowed!)
- Shows how to use Java’s modern date/time library like a boss ⏳

## 📘 Project 2: Basic Calculator with Switch 🧮💡

A simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Includes error handling for division by zero.

### 🌟 Features

- ✅ Takes two numbers and an operator from the user
- ✅ Uses a `switch` statement to determine the operation
- ✅ Handles invalid operators and division-by-zero ❌

### 👇 Sample Output

Enter your first Number: 10
Choose an operator(+, -, *, /): *
Enter your second number: 5
Result: 50.0



### 🔥 Bonus Logic Concepts

- Arithmetic operators in Java
- Working with `char` input
- `switch-case` statement mastery
- Defensive programming 🛡️

## 💡 Mini Challenge Ideas

Want to stretch your Java muscles? Try these:

- 🔁 Add a loop so the calculator keeps running until the user types "exit"
- ✨ Allow the age calculator to return a fun message for certain ages (e.g. “You’re finally 18! Welcome to adulthood!”)
- 🎂 Build a birthday countdown feature using `ChronoUnit.DAYS.between()`
